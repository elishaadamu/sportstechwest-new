<p>When I saw the Women’s National Championship game being broadcast on <a href="https://www.espn.com/espnw/"><strong>ESPN</strong></a>, it hit me. This wasn’t just any game. It was happening right in <strong>Cary, NC</strong>, just minutes from my hometown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina"><strong>Raleigh</strong></a>. How could I not go? <strong>UNC Women’s Soccer</strong> has a legacy worth witnessing in person, and I wanted to experience that energy firsthand.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-journey-to-the-stadium">The Journey to the Stadium</h2>

<p>Parking in Cary? <strong>Chaos</strong>. Finding a spot was one thing, but getting to the actual stadium was another. I had to navigate through a <strong>maze</strong>—out to the street, around a patch of forest, and finally to the field. By the time I arrived, it felt like I had already been on an adventure. Little did I know, the trip back to my car later would be even more eventful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-atmosphere">The Atmosphere</h2>

<p>The first thing I noticed? <strong>Carolina Blue</strong> everywhere. About <strong>90%</strong> of the crowd was made up of UNC fans, and it’s not hard to see why. <strong>UNC Women’s Soccer</strong> isn’t just dominant—they’re <strong>legendary</strong>. Consider this: over <strong>40 NCAA Tournament appearances</strong>, <strong>32 Final Fours</strong>, and a mind-blowing <strong>22 National Championships</strong>. They have defined what it means to be the gold standard in college sports.</p>

<h2 id="62--the-game-itself">62 &amp; The Game Itself</h2>

<p>First Half Possession vs. Second Half Adjustments
Wake Forest controlled the first half with 62% possession, more shots, and more corners, keeping UNC on the back foot. But in the second half, UNC flipped the script, retaining more possession and creating better attacking opportunities.</p>

<p>One big difference? Olivia Thomas started finding more space. UNC’s adjustments allowed her to get on the ball in dangerous areas, leading to more chances to get a shot off. The breakthrough came in the 62nd minute and that was all they needed.</p>

<p>UNC didn’t play their best defensive game. Wake Forest still had chances, but UNC came out unscathed. Sometimes, it’s not about locking down defensively but making the most of your key moments.</p>

<p>What to ask: How did UNC’s tactical shift open up space for Olivia? Did they press higher or just transition more efficiently?</p>

<p>Lastly, the game was intense but scrappy. Neither team had a clear upper hand and it was constant back and forth. But then UNC’s attack started breaking through. Their pressure led to a big opportunity: a free kick right outside the penalty box. It was one of those moments where the air in the stadium changes.</p>

<p>The 62% possession in the first half, followed by UNC flipping the script and scoring in the 62nd minute, perfectly illustrates the shift in momentum.</p>

  <img class="img-2" src="/assets/images/blog-img/NCWS_3.jpg" alt="NCWS_3" />
</div>

<p>The shot was <strong>perfect</strong>. Struck clean, it sailed past the keeper and into the back of the net. That goal would seal the game and give UNC yet another <strong>championship</strong> to add to their historic legacy.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-celebration">The Celebration</h2>

<p>After the final whistle, the stadium erupted. Fans, alums, and even casual spectators were caught up in the <strong>joy</strong> of the moment. I met some <strong>UNC grads</strong> who were thrilled to share their school pride and talk about what brought me to the game. The energy was <strong>infectious</strong>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my phone was nearly <strong>dead</strong>, so I couldn’t capture the postgame celebrations as much as I wanted to. That was a little frustrating, but being there in the moment made up for it.</p>

<h2 id="the-journey-back">The Journey Back</h2>

<p>Getting back to my car was a whole new adventure. This time, I decided to take the <strong>shortcut through the woods</strong>. With my phone completely <strong>dead</strong>, I had to depend on the person in front of me and their flashlight to guide the way. Thankfully, I made it out without twisting an ankle or getting lost.</p>

<p>Once I got to my car, the parking lot was <strong>gridlocked</strong>. With no phone to distract me, I turned on the <strong>radio</strong> and used the time to reflect. Sitting there, I couldn’t help but appreciate the experience: the game, the crowd, and what it meant to witness such a <strong>historic program</strong> in action.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="final-reflections">Final Reflections</h2>

<p>This wasn’t just a game; it was an <strong>experience</strong>. From the <strong>chaos of parking</strong> to the <strong>electric atmosphere</strong> of a UNC championship win, the night was <strong>unforgettable</strong>. It reminded me of why sports matter so much. They’re about more than <strong>competition</strong>—they’re about <strong>shared moments</strong>, <strong>passion</strong>, and the stories we get to take home.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://hoopheadspod.com/a-brief-history-of-basketball/">basketball</a> first started, players dribbled with soccer balls until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalding_(company)#:~:text=However%2C%20many%20NBA%20players%20complained,backboard%2C%20and%20cut%20their%20fingers.">Spalding</a> manufactured the first official basketball for the sport, improving its design to allow better handling and dribbling. <a href="https://soccerballworld.com/history-of-the-soccer-ball/">Soccer balls</a> at the time were too flat to bounce well and too slick to grip, making dribbling nearly impossible. This innovation, a basketball designed for better grip, bounce, and control, transformed the way the game was played.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Bumps that enabled modern day palming of the ball</p>

<p>The redesigned basketball not only allowed players to dribble effectively but also enabled them to control the ball when shooting or carrying it. That breakthrough opened the door for dribbling to evolve into an art form. From the crossover to the hesitation to the spin, all these moves we celebrate today wouldn’t exist without that critical step forward.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-spalding-and-naismith-shaped-generations-of-thinkers">How Spalding and Naismith Shaped Generations of Thinkers</h2>

<p>The collaboration between <strong>Spalding and Naismith</strong> wasn’t just about solving a problem; it was about <a href="https://www.evp.vc/opinion/four-technologies-driving-innovation-in-the-nba-and-beyond">innovation</a>. They saw the potential for basketball to be more than just a game. They envisioned a sport where tools and ideas could evolve alongside the athletes, making the game more dynamic and exciting.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog-img/Fair_Use_for_site.gif" alt="How Spalding and Naismith Shaped Generations of Thinkers" /></p>

<p>That mindset inspired generations of thinkers to push the boundaries of what’s possible in sports. Their creation of a <a href="https://coachtube.com/users/betterbasketball">better basketball</a> wasn’t just about performance; it was about unlocking creativity. <strong>With a ball that could be dribbled more effectively</strong>, players could suddenly invent their own moves, express their individuality, and rewrite the playbook.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://sportstechwest.com/analytics-culture">BTE Analytics</a>, we carry forward that same spirit. We believe that innovation in sports isn’t just about technology; it’s about making the game more accessible, more engaging, and more meaningful. Just as Spalding and Naismith’s design opened up a new world of possibilities for athletes, we’re pushing the limits by giving players new ways to understand and monetize their performance.</p>

<p>Through our <strong>advanced metrics</strong>, we’re not just measuring the game; we’re redefining how it’s played and experienced. Athletes today have the tools not only to perform but also to leave a lasting legacy. Innovation like this continues to shape sports, and we’re proud to be part of that journey.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-style-and-tendencies-matter">Why Style and Tendencies Matter</h2>

<p>I’ve always said, <strong><em>the numbers don’t tell the whole story-highlights do</em></strong>. And let’s be real: with full game viewership on the decline, like it or not, highlights drive the sport.</p>

<p>That’s why we’re focused on metrics that bring the highlights to life. Fans don’t just want to know you scored 20 points; they want to see how you scored them. Was it the pull-up jumper in crunch time? The no-look assist that caught the defense sleeping? Or that lethal hesitation move that froze your defender?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog-img/First_Designs_for_basketball.webp" alt="First_Designs_for_basketball" /></p>

<p>Our dribble metrics are built to capture those moments. We spotlight the style that separates you from everyone else. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_player">soccer players(football player)</a>, it’s the same idea. Are you the player who dismantles defenders with your footwork, or the one orchestrating the attack with pinpoint passes? Those tendencies and styles aren’t just stats—they’re your identity.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog-img/soccer-player.webp" alt="Soccer player" /></p>

<h2 id="the-bte-way-advancing-the-game">The BTE Way: Advancing the Game</h2>

<p>Just as <a href="https://sportstechwest.com/assets/images/blog-img/First_Designs_for_basketball.webp">Spalding’s design advanced basketball</a> in its early days, BTE Analytics is taking the next step in how the game is seen, understood, and played. While traditional metrics measure what happened, we focus on <em>how</em> it happened and <em>why</em> it matters.</p>

<p>Our innovative approach brings modern tools to basketball, enabling athletes to measure the subtle but critical aspects of their game, like tendencies and efficiency off the dribble. For example, imagine knowing exactly how many defenders were beaten with a crossover or the percentage of successful possessions initiated by a hesitation dribble. These are the insights that not only help players refine their craft but also allow fans and brands to connect with their unique style.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog-img/2.gif" alt="basketball analysis" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog-img/basketball-metric.webp" alt="basketball-metric" /></p>

<p>This is more than analytics, it’s storytelling for the <a href="https://www.modernathlete.co.za/">modern athlete</a>. By combining our advanced metrics with the game’s visual appeal, we give athletes a platform to show their personality and define their legacy in a way that’s never been done before.</p>

<h2 id="empowering-athletes-and-promoting-data-equity">Empowering Athletes and Promoting Data Equity</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog-img/1871_Albert_Spalding_Baseball-card-Boston_Red_Stockings.webp" alt="1871_Albert_Spalding_Baseball-card-Boston_Red_Stockings" /></p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Albert Spalding baseball card</p>
<p>At BTE Analytics, our mission goes beyond performance metrics. We’re committed to leveling the playing field for athletes through <a href="https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/">data equity</a>. Too often, the data athletes generate benefits others—teams, leagues, or sponsors—without the athlete getting their fair share.</p>

<p>We’re changing that. By highlighting tendencies, style, and individuality, we empower athletes to take ownership of their data and use it to tell their own stories. Whether it’s <strong>building a brand, attracting sponsors, or connecting with fans</strong>, our platform gives athletes the tools to monetize their performance and gain value from the game they’ve dedicated their lives to.</p>

<div class="image-gallery" style="text-align: center">

  <img class="img-2" src="/assets/images/blog-img/Dr._James_Naismith.webp" alt="Dr._James_Naismith" />
</div>

<p>When I started this company, it wasn’t just about giving athletes tools to improve. It was to show the world what makes them unique and efficient through scores and values in a way that incentivizes them. By creating a system that highlights what makes athletes stand out, we give them the means to take control of their narrative and legacy.</p>

<p>That’s why at BTE Analytics, we’re building something different. We’re not just about performance. We’re about <em>personality</em>. Because in the end, it’s not just about being good.
It’s about being different and defining your legacy within the game.</p>

<p>Being surrounded by the world’s most elite athletes at the <a href="https://teamusa.org/USA-House">USA House</a> reminded me why I started this journey. Over two days, I had the privilege of meeting iconic figures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_Carter">Maverick Carter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrivera/">Paul Rivera</a> while walking in Paris. We discussed everything from sports to <strong>business</strong>, life, and the importance of venturing beyond the field.</p>

<p>These conversations reinforced my belief in empowering athletes with tools to redefine success whether it’s through <a href="https://sporttech.io/">sports tech</a> or life off the field. Stories of triumph and challenges alike echoed the importance of our mission at <strong>BTE Analytics</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="witnessing-history-in-the-making">Witnessing History in the Making</h3>

<p>I had the once in a lifetime opportunity to attend the gold medal match between <a href="https://www.usoc.org/">USA</a> and <a href="https://www.cbf.com.br/">Brazil</a>, where the legendary <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/meet-marta-the-record-breaking-brazilian-football-player/UAWxrX7MR4XIfg?hl=en">Marta</a> played her final Olympic game. The story of how I got there thanks to a last minute invitation from a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp">VC</a> is one for another day, but that match was more than historic.</p>

<p>It was a catalyst for discussions on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology">tech industry trends</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/go-to-market-strategy">go to market strategies</a>, and how innovative <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp">business models</a> are transforming sports tech.

<p>Our discussions with the <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc">Olympic Committee</a> and <a href="https://la28.org/">LA Olympics</a> organizers opened doors to expand our impact.

<h2 id="exclusive-events-and-networking-opportunities">Exclusive Events and Networking Opportunities</h2>

<p>Attending the Future of Education Technology Conference (FETC) and showcasing our innovative BTE BallCODE game was an exhilarating experience. This game uniquely combines analytics with coding in a gaming format, making learning accessible and engaging for everyone. Beyond our contribution, it was invigorating to witness a range of pioneering educational technologies.</p>

<p>One of the standout moments for me was seeing Kai XR’s presence at the conference. It was particularly heartening because a friend of mine has been dedicating immense effort in the educational space through Kai XR. Their work, much like ours, aims to transform traditional learning paradigms by leveraging cutting-edge technology to create immersive, interactive educational experiences. The conference was a testament to the vibrant future of educational technology, where tools like ours and Kai XR’s play pivotal roles in shaping innovative learning environments.</p>

<p>At FETC 2024, the focus for me was esports, VR/AR, and AI in education highlighted the growing importance of these technologies in enhancing learning experiences and preparing students for the future.</p>

<p>Esports: The conference showcased the educational potential of esports, emphasizing its role in promoting career and college readiness. The CDW esports arena in the expo hall was a key feature, allowing attendees to witness live gaming competitions. This setup provided insights into how esports can be integrated into educational settings to foster engagement, teamwork, and strategic thinking​​.</p>

<p>VR/AR: Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) technologies were also a significant focus, with hands-on immersive experiences being a major draw for attendees. These technologies offer innovative ways to engage students in interactive learning environments, making complex concepts more accessible and enhancing the overall learning experience. The use of VR/AR in education is seen as a way to merge virtual and physical play areas for collaborative learning, as showcased by Kai’s Education with its mixed-reality feature for Meta Quest 3​​​​.</p>

<p>AI in Education: Artificial Intelligence (AI) was another key theme, with discussions centered on its role in transforming educational practices. The conference featured keynotes on the future of AI in education, exploring how AI can be used to personalize learning, automate administrative tasks, and provide real-time insights into student performance. The focus was on building AI literacy among students, as demonstrated by MagicSchool AI’s platform, which aims to teach students responsible use of AI while unlocking new learning opportunities​​​​.</p>

<p>These topics at FETC 2024 underscore the intersection of technology and education, highlighting the potential of esports, VR/AR, and AI to revolutionize the learning landscape. By integrating these technologies into educational frameworks, educators can provide students with engaging, relevant, and forward-thinking learning experiences.</p>]]></content><author><name>Rashad West</name></author><category term="Education" /><category term="FETC" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[FETC Future of Education Tech Conference]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CES Sports AI XR</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/CES_Sports_AI_XR" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CES Sports AI XR" /><published>2024-01-21T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-01-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/CES_Sports_AI_XR</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/CES_Sports_AI_XR"><![CDATA[<h1 id="ces_xr_ai_main_show">CES_XR_AI_Main_Show</h1>

This new fan data is being used by brands and properties to better target and engage with these audiences.</p>

<p>Another significant focus was on the ROI of women’s sports, where Sports Innovation Lab shared insights on the increasing investment in women’s sports media and sponsorships, backed by data and case studies. This reflects a growing recognition of the value and potential in women’s sports.</p>

<p>There was also a session titled “2034: A Sports Odyssey - Imagining the Stadium of the Future,” where experts discussed the future of sports and entertainment venues. The themes included the integration of AI, Mixed-Reality, and Cybersecurity in enhancing the live sports experience.</p>

<p>These discussions at CES Sports Zone and Sports Innovation Lab Lounge indicate a broader trend in the sports industry, where technology, data analytics, and changing fan dynamics are reshaping how sports are consumed, marketed, and experienced.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sports_Innovation_Lab_Lounge]]></summary></entry></feed>
